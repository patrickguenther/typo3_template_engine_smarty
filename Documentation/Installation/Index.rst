Installation
============

This extension does not provide the Smarty template engine itself. If you run typo3 in composer mode it should be
automatically installed. If you are not using composer, you can get smarty at: http://www.smarty.net/ and extract all
of its code into the following directory: EXT:smarty_template_engine/vendor/smarty/smarty
Create the directories if necessary.
